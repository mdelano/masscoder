					<h1>A lil' bit about me</h1>
					<div class="job lil-bit-o-padding">
						<h3>Code</h3>
						<p>I've always tried to stay as versatile as I could. In part, because having more tools gives you more solutions to problems. But also, like many devs, I just can't help getting into new things. Anytime I stumble onto something on <a>hacker news</a> it ends up becoming a weekend project.</p>

						<h5>Back End</h5>
						<p>I'm a solid backend and middle tier developer. Anywhere I work I tend to spend loads of my time there. I enjoy it because I'm good at it and when someone says "I have a problem" I can use my ability there to solve it. I've done lots of DB work with Oracle, SQL Server, MySQL, Mongo, and even a little with RavenDB. I've also been a daily dev in C# .Net, Java SE, and PHP. I like working with them all.</p>

						<h5>Front End</h5>
						<p>I love front end development. Anytime there's a front end project I try to get my hands on it. Mostly because I want to get better it. I think the futer of  dev will center around the front end. So many lower layers of the stack are becoming commodities and are being offered as a service. <em>(I was bummed I didn't think of Backend As A Service first. But, <a href="http://www.kinvey.com/">kinvey</a>, a local company, is doing some really neat stuff in that space. </em>

						<p>I feel confident working in a modern front end stack. The one I work in now uses Saas-Bootstrap, jQuery, Modernizer, Backbone.JS, grunt, jasmine, and Require.JS. The site your visting now site doesn't have such a deep stack. It's using Foundation, Saas...etc.</p>

						<h3>Fun</h3>

						<h5>Back Country Camping (Winter!)</h5>
						<p>I camp, when it's really cold, and wet, and windy. It's an adventure. It's really fun to get out of your shelter and try to stay happy without everything that makes you comfortable. Side affects are really beuatiful views, self confidence, and whiskey. If this type of thing piques your interest I recommend <em>Breadloaf Wilderness, Green Mountain National Park, VT</em> and <em>Keen Valley, Adirondacks, NY</em>.</p>
						<h5>Brewing</h5>
						<p>Brewing beer is a lot of fun. It comes with so much history and chemistry and simplicity and beer. It's such a simple thing.</p>
					
						<h3>Family</h3>
						<p>I live outside of Portsmouth, NH with my baby daughter, Maizie, and my parter in life, Margaret. I'm lucky.</p>

								<h3>A little about MediaSilo:</h3>
								<p><a href="http://www.mediasilo.com/">MediaSilo</a> is about collaborating on media. It stores and manages video for the largest production companies on the planet: Viacom, NBC, and Oprah!. And loads more where they came from.</p>

								<h3>Stack:</h3>

							</div>
							<div class="job-profile">
								<h3>What I Worked On:</h3>

								<p>When I came on board, MediaSilo was a team of 7 and they have increased that to 15 since then. They are making a strong run at the market and there are loads of opportunities to build products to support it. Lot's of the work I've done here has been greenfields dev. </p>
								<p>I lead the dev team here. We've been busy. We've written a couple web apps with half a dozen more on the burner. We've also written a public REST API which we consume ourselves to keep us honest.</p>

								<p>Our backend dev consists fo a lot of Java and PHP. Our primary DB's ar MySQL and Mongo and we are currently branching towards ElasticSearch to support our API <em>(which was just released to <a href="http://www.elasticsearch.org/blog/1-0-0-released/">version 1</a>, by the way)</em>.</p>
								<p>Our front end stack is Saas-Bootstrap, jQuery, Modernizer, Backbone.JS, grunt, jasmine, and Require.JS.</p>

								<h4>A little about Karmaloop:</h4>
								<p><a href="http://www.karmaloop.com/">Karmaloop</a> is an online retailer of "Street Wear". I didn't know street wear before karmaloop showed me the light. Now I'm wicked hip. :). They sell lots of close. 200M worth last year.</p>

								<h3>Stack:</h3>
								<p>C# .Net; SQL Server; Entity Framework; Unity; jQuery; Mustache;</p>
							</div>
							<div class="job-profile">
								<h3>What I Worked On:</h3>

								<p>I was a dveloper on the core product, Karmaloop.com. Karmaloop.com is a multi-tenant site that supports 5 e-commerce sites in total, MissKL.com, BrickHarbor.com, Boylston Trading Co., and Karmaloop.com. From a backend perspective supporting multipl e-commerce sites made total sense. They all had overlapping functionality: browse, search, product details, cart, payment. So, supporting them all with a single back end made sense. or the front end Mustache and Razor came in handy. We had a core set of templates and styles that were overriden in cases where the UX needed to be different. </p>

								<p>This was an awesome company to work for. It really was. They had an awesome culture. I miss them.</p>

								<p>In addition to core product development, secondary projects gave me the opportunity to work with RavenDB and MongoDB. We built a search application that would index all of the sites pages. We need blazing fast results so we turned to these document DBs.</p>

								<p>I really enjoyed working on this tight knit team. The group of developers I joined here had been working together for years. This gave me some great exposure to seeing the value in a strong team. I learned a lot about good communication and what it looked like to lead a team.</p>

								<p>Primarily we worked on two products, StudentAid.com and FAFSA.com. While working here we redeveloped StudentAid.com entirely. The redevelopment took six strenuous months where we rewrote both the public facing website and the internal administrative application. During this project, I worked on a fun task where I wrote a collaborative algorithm which forcasted the total aid a student could expect based on comparitive financial and award data from millions of other applicants. As more data was collected the algorithm would produce more accurate forecasts.</p>
