								<h4>A little about MediaSilo:</h4>
								<p><a href="http://www.mediasilo.com/">MediaSilo</a> is about collaborating on media assets. It stores and manages assets for the largest production companies on the planet: Viacom, NBC, and Oprah! Loads more where they came from.</p>

								<h3>Stack:</h3>
								<p>PHP; Java SE; Apache; MySQL; Mongo; *nix; Backbone; Saas; Bamboo; git/p>

								<h3>What I Worked On:</h3>

								<p>I really enjoyed working on this tight knit team. The group of developers I joined here had been working together for years. This gave me some great exposure to seeing the value in a strong team. I learned a lot about good communication and what it looked like to lead a team.</p>

								<p>Primarily we worked on two products, StudentAid.com and FAFSA.com. While working here we redeveloped StudentAid.com entirely. The redevelopment took six strenuous months where we rewrote both the public facing website and the internal administrative application. During this project, I worked on a fun task where I wrote a collaborative algorithm which forcasted the total aid a student could expect based on comparitive financial and award data from millions of other applicants. As more data was collected the algorithm would produce more accurate forecasts.</p>
